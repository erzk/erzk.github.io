The [working paper](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/enhancing-central-bank-communications-with-behavioural-insights.pdf) version (2018) is available from in the Bank of England's WP series. This version contains only one experiment.

We published blog posts describing the results on the [Bank Underground](https://bankunderground.co.uk/2018/11/22/simply-is-best-enhancing-trust-and-understanding-of-central-banks-through-better-communications/) blog and [BIT's page](https://www.bi.team/blogs/how-many-people-really-understand-inflation-and-interest-rates/).

This study was very well received and had large policy impact. We were cited by Mark Carney in his 2019 Sintra [speech](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2019/remarks-to-open-policy-panel-by-mark-carney.pdf).
