I am an Advisor at the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub London. Before that, I was a Senior Research Data Scientist in the Advanced Analytics Division at the Bank of England, and Visiting Fellow at the University College London. I earned my PhD from UCL in the Department of Experimental Psychology working on Cognitive Neuroscience of Language.

My interests can be broadly described as digital finance and innovation. Specifically, I am interested in applying data science and experimental methods to study macroeconomics. I am an experienced programmer, researcher, and project manager.
